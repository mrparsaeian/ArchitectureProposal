### Overview

This guide will cover:

1. Installing and configuring **Snort** as an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**.
2. Setting up **Prometheus** to collect and monitor metrics, including Snort logs.
3. Configuring **Grafana** for visualizing network metrics and Snort alerts.
4. Using **HashiCorp Vault** for securely storing and retrieving passwords.

### Prerequisites

* **Ansible** installed on the management server.
* **HashiCorp Vault** configured, running, and accessible.
* **Prometheus** and **Grafana** should already be installed for monitoring purposes.
* **Root or sudo privileges** for installing and configuring packages.

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

* Create an environment file (e.g., `env.yml`) to store key configuration variables:
    * **Grafana host** (e.g., `localhost` or IP address).
    * **Prometheus URL** for integration with other monitoring tools.
    * **Snort configuration path** (e.g., `/etc/snort`).

### Step 2: Use Vault to Store Credentials

* Store sensitive information, such as passwords for **Grafana**, **Prometheus**, and **Snort**, in **HashiCorp Vault**.
    * Save passwords in a specific secret path (e.g., `secret/network_device_passwords`).
* Set up **Vault token** as an environment variable to securely authenticate during Ansible playbook execution.

### Step 3: Install and Configure Snort

* Use **Ansible** to install Snort on the designated server.
* Configure Snort:
    * Set up Snort in **Network Intrusion Detection Mode** to actively monitor network traffic.
    * Place Snort configuration files under `/etc/snort/`.
    * Customize **Snort rules** to detect unauthorized access attempts and unusual traffic patterns.
* Enable Snort to run as a **systemd service** to ensure it is always running.

### Step 4: Install and Configure Prometheus Node Exporter

* Install **Prometheus Node Exporter** on the Snort server.
    * Node Exporter collects **system-level metrics** and helps Prometheus monitor Snort logs.
* Configure **Prometheus**:
    * Add **Snort log monitoring** to Prometheus by creating a Prometheus job to scrape Snort metrics from the Node Exporter.
    * Update the Prometheus configuration to include Snort logs and other system metrics (e.g., bandwidth usage, packet loss).

### Step 5: Configure Grafana Dashboards

* Use Ansible to add **Grafana dashboards** for monitoring:
    * Set up dashboards for **Snort intrusion detection** logs.
    * Create panels to visualize **network metrics** such as:
        * **Bandwidth usage**.
        * **Latency**.
        * **Packet loss**.
    * Integrate **Prometheus** as a data source for Grafana to ensure that Snort and system metrics are displayed effectively.

### Step 6: Automation Using Ansible

* Use **Ansible Playbook** to automate all configuration steps:
    * Retrieve passwords securely from Vault.
    * Install **Snort** and configure it using Ansible templates.
    * Install **Node Exporter** for Prometheus integration.
    * Update **Prometheus** and **Grafana** configurations using Ansible tasks.

### Step 7: Securely Retrieve Credentials

* During the playbook execution:
    * **Retrieve credentials** from HashiCorp Vault using `hashivault_read` Ansible module.
    * Set the retrieved credentials as variables for configuring **Snort**, **Grafana**, and **Prometheus**.
* Export the **Vault token** to an environment variable before running the playbook to allow Ansible to access stored secrets.

### Step 8: Running the Ansible Playbook

* Set the Vault token:
    
    ```bash
    export VAULT_TOKEN="your-vault-token"
    ```
    
* Run the Ansible playbook to complete the setup:
    * **Install Snort** and configure it for **intrusion detection**.
    * Install **Prometheus Node Exporter** for data collection.
    * Update **Prometheus** configuration for **Snort log monitoring**.
    * Create **Grafana dashboards** for visualizing Snort alerts and network performance metrics.

### Summary of Configuration Steps

1. **Snort Installation and Configuration**:
    
    * Install Snort as an IDS and configure it to run continuously.
    * Set up Snort to generate alerts for unauthorized access and suspicious traffic.
2. **Prometheus and Node Exporter Setup**:
    
    * Use Prometheus Node Exporter to gather system metrics from the Snort server.
    * Update Prometheus configuration to scrape Snort alerts and metrics.
3. **Grafana Dashboards**:
    
    * Create dashboards for **network performance** and **intrusion detection** using Grafana.
    * Add panels for **Snort alerts**, **bandwidth usage**, **latency**, and **packet loss** to provide comprehensive network monitoring.
4. **Secure Password Management**:
    
    * Use **HashiCorp Vault** to securely store and manage sensitive passwords.
    * Retrieve credentials securely in the Ansible playbook to prevent exposure.
5. **Automation with Ansible**:
    
    * Use Ansible to automate the entire process, ensuring repeatable and consistent configuration across all systems.
    * Integrate HashiCorp Vault to enhance security by keeping passwords out of the playbooks.
