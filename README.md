====================

**Comprehensive Strategy for Mission-Critical Infrastructure Optimization and Automation for Hermes Corp**

This repository contains a detailed proposal to optimize and automate the mission-critical infrastructure. The goal is to ensure that all systems are reliable, scalable, and highly available, helping the organization operate smoothly 24/7.

Overview
--------

The strategy outlined in this repository aims to:

* **Automate key infrastructure tasks** to reduce manual work, minimize errors, and ensure consistent configurations.
* **Optimize resource usage** to improve system performance and scalability.
* **Improve monitoring and anomaly detection** to proactively identify and address potential issues before they become critical.
* **Ensure high availability** for all core services and reduce downtime using robust failover and backup techniques.

Key Areas of Focus
------------------

### 1. Automation & Optimization

* **Tools Used**: Ansible, Python scripts, VMware PowerCLI.
* **Main Features**:
    * Automated ESXi installation and configuration on HP servers.
    * Network device setup using Ansible for Cisco Nexus, FortiGate, and other switches.
    * Deployment of up to 200 virtual machines (VMs) on ESXi hosts using automation tools.
    * Proactive monitoring of system metrics and anomaly detection using tools like Prophet.

### 2. Monitoring & High-Availability

* **Monitoring Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack.
* **Features**:
    * Real-time metrics collection and visualization.
    * Anomaly detection using time series forecasting and machine learning algorithms to spot unusual system behavior.
    * High availability through Kubernetes orchestration, redundancy mechanisms, and automatic failover.

### 3. Database & Messaging System Management

* **Databases Managed**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis.
* **Features**:
    * Data replication and failover to ensure high availability and reliability.
    * Automated backups to protect against data loss.
    * Messaging queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka) set up for efficient communication between microservices.

### 4. Network & Security

* **Network Management**: Automated using Ansible for consistency across network devices.
* **Security and Redundancy**:
    * Use of VRRP and HSRP for router redundancy.
    * Link aggregation to provide high availability and better network performance.
    * Firewall policies and access controls to enhance security.

### 5. Backup & Disaster Recovery

* **Backup Strategy**:
    * Daily incremental backups and weekly full backups.
    * Integrity checks and recovery drills to ensure reliable data restoration.
    * Use of cloud storage for offsite backups to provide redundancy.
* **Disaster Recovery Plan**:
    * Comprehensive strategy including recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).
    * Automated scripts for recovery to minimize downtime.
